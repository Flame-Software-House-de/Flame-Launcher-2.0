# Flame-Launcher-2.0
Hi,
I am TheFlameBe.
I have developed this Launcher as option for all that donÂ´t want 2 or more Gamelaunchers for there Games. In the future I want to get support for all Game Launchers. Additonally this is only the Alpha but its here so have a little bit indulgence in using it. In Alpha 0.0.1 is only Steam Support available and some features are missing. Like dowloading Steam Games but these will come in the future. Last but not least if you find any issues you can report them in the Issues (https://github.com/TheFlameB/Flame-Launcher-2.0/issues) tab.

### PS: I would recommend to install it in a non Administatorrestricted folder like Programms(x86) because when you du that you have to run the Launcher as Administrator!
