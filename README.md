# Flame-Launcher-2.0
Hi,
I am TheFlameBe.
I have developed this Launcher as option for all that donÂ´t want 2 or more Gamelaunchers for there Games. In the future I want to get support for all Game Launchers. Additonally this is only the Alpha but its here so have a little bit indulgence in using it. In Alpha 0.0.1 is only Steam Support available and some features are missing. Like dowloading Steam Games but these will come in the future.
# Alpha 0.0.1 
Added:
+ Basic Steam Support
+ Spotify Intigration
+ Single addition of Games and Apps
+ Basic Web Integration
+ Basic Audioplayer(pre-Alpha)
+ Basic Overlay(pre-Alpha)
+ Basic Miniplayer(pre-Alpha)
